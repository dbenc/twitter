# Twitter Navigability

This project was made as a github pages project, so it's advised to view it at https://dbenc.github.io/twitter/ for the intended experience.

## Overview
This repository contains a project undertaken for the course Data Science Laboratory at Eötvös Lóránd University. The primary objective of this project is to explore the navigability of the Twitter network. Specifically, the aim is to determine whether and when the network is navigable. Subsequently, the project endeavors to devise an algorithm capable of identifying a route between two Twitter users, based solely on the location of the destination and the locations of neighboring nodes.

## Project Objectives
The project aims to develop an efficient routing algorithm for a real-world network. To achieve success, several key questions must be addressed:

1. What makes routing possible?
2. What kind of algorithm should be used?
3. How does the layout of the network determine the success of routing?
4. How does the length of the route influence the success of routing?
5. Is there a difference in routing for different cities?
