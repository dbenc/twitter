# Brief

This project tries to find an efficienct routing algorithm on a real world network. For this algorithm to be sucessful, a couple questions are needed to be answeared:
- "What makes the routing possible?"
- "What kind of algorithm should be used?"
- "How the layout of the network determines the sucess of the routing?"
- "How the lenght of the route determines the sucess if the routing?"
- "Is there a difference in routing for different cities?".
